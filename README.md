# ICS-Timetabler

Todo:
- queue system so that cal_data doesn't get overwritten by two people simultaneously
- (can also make it generate a random name for the cal_data then remove)

- Automatic download of new timetables for all users every set period of time
- (can use cron jobs, look into it)
- (need to check to see if timetable data has changed from last check such as new lectures, if so update, otherwise don't)

- Update ics_processor to write all processed data to database, need to provide
- user data to find correct location to upload data

- add anything else that might need work on
